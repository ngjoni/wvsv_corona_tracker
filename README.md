![Corona Tracker Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/beat-virus/corona_tracker/master/media/CoronaTrace_Logo_V3.png)

During the wirvsvirushackathon.org challenge, we collaborate on Discord to create a COVID-19 tracking app.

Planned features include:

- Self-report health status (diagnosed/cured)
- Upload your friends (anonymized, of course!) 
- Get notified immediately if one of your 1st/2nd/3rd grade friends gets diagnosed or cured
- View infected areas on a map (anonymized)
- store data of fever measurement at least twice a day
- check movement historys frequently to detect who had contact to (newly uncovered) infected persons

### Preparations for development
1. In the root folder, please execute the following command: `mvn clean install` -> **IMPORTANT**: You need to set the correct JDK Version either in your "JAVA_HOME" environment variable or in your IDE, otherwise maven will throw errors.
2. You might need to refresh the root folder.
